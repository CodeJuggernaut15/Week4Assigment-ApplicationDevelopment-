# **Constructors** 

Constructor are used in order to initialize the fields of the class. It gets executed when the program starts. 

## **Encapslation** 

Encapsulation does help us to keep the fields inaccessible directly.  In order to access the values present in the fields that are encapsulated we do use getter methods. If we need to initialize the value to the variable then we need to use the setter method. Unlike other methods we cannot directly access or manipulate the value present. The keyword private is used in oder to make the value private. 

## **Classes**

It is known as the blueprint of the program. For example a class can have a general name like Animal , which does contain different fields necessary to denote the animal like name , species, weight etc. A class can have different objects present which specifies it’s types. 

## **Objects**

It is known as the the part of the class. If class is itself a board term then object is the type that it falls under. In the above explanation of the class Animal it’s objects can be Monkey , pandas, zebra etc. Every objects does have it’s own properties like name, color etc. 

## **OOP principles real life use case**

This concept can be used in order to relate the real world objects and do apply programming concepts to work on it.
